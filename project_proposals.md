## Capstone Project Proposals

In consideration of the specified requirements, let me suggest the following potential ideas for my Capstone project:

* Proposal 1: [Accumulations for Seattle Public Utilities's rain gauges located throughout Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/city-of-seattle/seattle-observed-monthly-rain-gauge-accumulations/home).
These monthly data goes from October 2002 to May 2017. It provides information on rain patters which are relevant in both public and private services, such as water supply, waste management, fire prevention or even something as simple as car washing scheduling. For instance, spots that provide parking/tuning/washing services might be able to distribute their focus and investements on one task or another depending on rain patterns.
 
* Proposal 2: [Accidents in France from 2005 to 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedlahlou/accidents-in-france-from-2005-to-2016/home).
In order to develop public politics for the prevention of car accidents, it seems reasonable and necessary to study gathered data on previous events. These particular set has access to an impressive amount of potentially relevant information associated to accidents, such as date, place, type and characteristics of the road, outcome of the event and much more. If one can find trends in this data then it might be possible to reduce casualties and injuries associated to car accidents by politics that target specific correlations.

* Proposal 3: [Seattle Fire 911 calss](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Seattle-Fire-911-Calls-from-3-1-2010-to-3-1-2011/d9j6-s59d).
There seems to be accessible data to fire 911 calls from Seattle, starting from 2010 all the way to present day (2012 and on in other data sets in the same repository). While this data is interesting in itself, could it be possible to study simultanously this set and the one in Proposal 1, in order to see if rain data alone is a substantial factor in the amount of fire 911 calls?
